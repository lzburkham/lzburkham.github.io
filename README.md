## Professional Self-Assessment

During my time in Southern New Hampshire University’s Bachelor of Computer Science program, I have not only learned many fundamental skills as a career software developer but have also gained confidence in myself as a professional to take pride in my accomplishments. I have learned how to collaborate with my peers by working through challenging coding examples and the most purposefully disorganized repositories and code bases you can imagine. I have spent many hours developing my skills in user experience and design interfacing through studying the SDLC of an Agile-built application and focused study on user accessibility through design. Alongside these skills that taught me how to be a better communicator and interpreter of a user’s needs when interacting with a piece of software, I also gained tangible experience developing my own artifacts. These deliverables stretched my budding coding skills into what they are and allowed me to begin to think more abstractly about how to solve certain situations. I learned how to develop and implement solutions using industry-standard security guidelines (and how to check my own code against previously exposed security flaws). I also gained skills in algorithmic processing focusing on efficiency in both time and space through developing with Object-Oriented Programming principles at the forefront of the program. In addition to the practice of OOP, I also spent considerable time focusing on why waterfall design methods and implementation so often fail in production environments. These areas of focus produced in me a desire to build and maintain applications that are resilient to failure and security breach through secure design and connectivity standards.

With these accomplishments in mind, I am presenting an artifact that I have refined in this course. It is a logging script that I wrote for Abilene Christian University to gather user access logs from the Azure AD SSO integration of the EBSCO Library Online software. This script is used to gather these logs and quantify data within the university ERP database. This script was written in 2021 to meet the reporting needs of the ACU Library for the multi-campus institutional user base.
This artifact is inclusive of all of the components of the intended course outcomes through its heavy manipulation of data both within the connected database as well as the data being pulled from the organization’s Azure SAML 2.0 SSO logs. I feel that it demonstrates a piece of software that can be improved to showcase the improvements that I have made as a software developer since writing it nearly a year ago, as well as showcases the amount of thought that was put into the project at its inception. This ePortfolio consists of an informal video Code Review, and Three code base enhancements with cooresponding narratives introducing the intended purpose of these enhancements from the original code base.
